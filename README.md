# Deep-Learning-Projects
In this I have coded some deep learning projects I found fascinating. Deep Learning in amalgamation with the theories of Leaning machines, has many applications in today's world. The application containst to solve many problems of non-linear optimization as well as to the aspects of Data Sciences. 
In Here my first project is entitiled LAB2_Deep_Learning. In this I have performed gradientBoosting on the famous Cancer Dataset whose extended version is XGBoost frequently used by the Kagglers around the world. The optimization graph obtained by that is shown below.
